Project from NetworkChuck Python Course:
This code creates a coffee shop barista to greet a customer and store their name in a variable.
Verifies the customer is not evil and if they have a nice beard (if they have a nice beard, the customer may skip the line)
If the customer is evil, they are not allowed to enter the store.
Barista asks customer what they would like from the menu, and calculates total for the customer based on their order.
